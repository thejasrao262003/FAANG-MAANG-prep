# 📅 August – Week 4 (Aug 22–31) – Full System Design Simulation & Review

## 🎯 Weekly Goal:
Integrate your learning by simulating full system design interviews. Design large-scale, end-to-end systems and polish your understanding of trade-offs. Simultaneously wrap up OS/CN/DBMS flashcards and quick revision.

## 🧠 Notes to Self

- Interviewers want trade-offs, not perfection — explain choices.
- Use numbers: “10M requests/day”, “1GB video uploads”, etc.
- Write down **3 things you learned** each day in Notion journal.

## 📌 Deliverables by End of Week

- [ ] ✅ 2 full system designs complete: Pastebin + YouTube
- [ ] ✅ OS, DBMS, CN flashcards created and reviewed
- [ ] ✅ 6 DSA problems + 1 mock OA attempted
- [ ] ✅ Blog published or finalized
- [ ] ✅ August learnings shared on LinkedIn
- [ ] ✅ Notion & GitHub organized for clean handoff into September
