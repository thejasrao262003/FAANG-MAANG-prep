# 🟡 August – System Design + Core CS Foundations

## 🎯 Objective:
This month is about leveling up your backend architecture knowledge with real-world system design principles. You’ll also reinforce essential CS subjects: Operating Systems, DBMS, and Computer Networks — all crucial for FAANG interviews.

### 📍 Week 1 (Aug 1–7) – Intro to System Design
**Focus**: System Design fundamentals, HLD patterns, distributed system basics.

#### System Design:
- [ ] Understand key components:
  - [ ] Load Balancer
  - [ ] Caching
  - [ ] Database Sharding & Replication
  - [ ] Message Queues
- [ ] Learn how to handle:
  - [ ] Read vs Write-heavy systems
  - [ ] Scalability, Availability, Consistency (CAP theorem)
- [ ] Study example: **URL Shortener**

#### CS Core:
- [ ] OS: Process vs Thread, CPU Scheduling
- [ ] CN: OSI Model, TCP/IP Basics

#### Content:
- [ ] Setup Notion System Design notes dashboard

---

### 📍 Week 2 (Aug 8–14) – Design Deep Dive + OS & DBMS
**Focus**: Building HLD answers, concurrency, DB internals.

#### System Design:
- [ ] Study example: **Rate Limiter**
- [ ] Design components:
  - [ ] Token Bucket vs Leaky Bucket
  - [ ] Redis for distributed rate limiting
  - [ ] Failover & Retry handling

#### CS Core:
- [ ] OS:
  - [ ] Virtual Memory, Paging, Segmentation
  - [ ] Context Switching, Mutex, Semaphore
- [ ] DBMS:
  - [ ] Indexes (B+ Tree, Hash), Transactions (ACID)
  - [ ] Normalization, Joins, Query Optimization

#### Content:
- [ ] Blog #4 draft: "How Rate Limiting Works in Scalable Systems"

---

### 📍 Week 3 (Aug 15–21) – Advanced Design + Networking
**Focus**: Building scalable infra; advanced DB & CN.

#### System Design:
- [ ] Study example: **File Storage System (e.g., Dropbox)**
- [ ] Design flow:
  - [ ] Chunking, Metadata Store, Upload/Download Service
  - [ ] Fault tolerance and durability
- [ ] Design practice: Design Twitter / Instagram Feed

#### CS Core:
- [ ] DBMS:
  - [ ] Isolation Levels, Deadlocks
  - [ ] CAP Theorem and BASE
- [ ] CN:
  - [ ] TLS Handshake, DNS Lookup, HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1
  - [ ] CDN, Load Balancing techniques

#### Mock Interviews:
- [ ] 1 mock interview: System Design

---

### 📍 Week 4 (Aug 22–31) – Synthesis + Integration
**Focus**: Review, mock, apply learnings.

#### System Design:
- [ ] Design from scratch:
  - [ ] Pastebin
  - [ ] YouTube-like video streaming system
- [ ] Draw architectural diagrams with components
- [ ] Review tradeoffs: Consistency vs Latency, Throughput vs Durability

#### CS Core:
- [ ] Revise all OS, DBMS, CN topics with flashcards
- [ ] Build quick recall mind maps

#### Mock Interviews:
- [ ] 2 mock interviews (1 HLD, 1 CS Core)

#### Content:
- [ ] Publish Blog #4
- [ ] Create System Design cheatsheet PDF
