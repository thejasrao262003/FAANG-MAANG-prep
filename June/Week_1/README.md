# 📅 June – Week 1 (June 1–7) – Kickoff & Foundation Building

## 🎯 Weekly Goal:
Start strong by building a solid foundation in DSA patterns and begin your first Low-Level Design (LLD) project. This week is all about structure, rhythm, and clean coding habits.

---

## ✅ Weekly Targets

### 🔹 DSA: Arrays, Strings, Sliding Window, Hash Maps

- [ ] Solve 35 Leetcode problems covering:
  - [ ] Arrays – Easy & Medium
  - [ ] Strings – Parsing, pattern matching
  - [ ] Sliding Window – Longest substring, max sum subarray
  - [ ] Hash Maps – Frequency count, first non-repeating
- [ ] Tag each problem with its pattern in your Notion/Tracker
- [ ] Track time taken per problem and review after 5 problems

### Recommended Problems:
- [ ] Two Sum
- [ ] Group Anagrams
- [ ] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- [ ] Maximum Subarray
- [ ] Valid Anagram
- [ ] Find All Duplicates in an Array

---

### 🔹 LLD: Design a Rate Limiter

- [ ] Learn and revise OOP principles:
  - [ ] Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism
  - [ ] Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion
- [ ] Build a Token Bucket based Rate Limiter:
  - [ ] Interface Design
  - [ ] Class breakdown
  - [ ] Time window logic
- [ ] Write unit tests and edge cases
- [ ] Document assumptions and decisions in README

---

### 🔹 Blog/Content

- [ ] Start draft: “Restarting DSA – Patterns That Matter”
- [ ] Outline key learnings from each problem pattern
- [ ] Optional: Share GitHub repo link with solutions on LinkedIn

## 🧠 Notes to Self

- Build the habit of **reviewing every solved problem** – don’t skip explanation.
- Use GitHub for clean commit logs — 1 commit = 1 concept learned.
- Write "What I Learned Today" in Notion every night (5 bullets max).

- [ ] ✅ 35 DSA problems solved and tracked
- [ ] ✅ Rate Limiter (basic version) implemented
- [ ] ✅ README + test cases added to GitHub
