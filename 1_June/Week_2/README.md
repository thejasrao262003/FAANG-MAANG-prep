# 📅 June – Week 2 (June 8–14) – Binary Search + Project Expansion

## 🎯 Weekly Goal:
Advance your DSA problem-solving to binary search and prefix sum patterns. Simultaneously, build on your LLD skills by starting a new hands-on project — a basic file storage system.

---

## ✅ Weekly Targets

### 🔹 DSA: Binary Search, Prefix Sums, Bit Manipulation

- [ ] Solve 35 Leetcode problems:
  - [ ] Binary Search (sorted arrays, rotated arrays, lower/upper bound)
  - [ ] Prefix Sums (subarray sum, range sum queries)
  - [ ] Bit Manipulation basics (parity, XOR tricks)
- [ ] Time your sessions and annotate solution complexity (O(n), O(log n))

### Recommended Problems:
- [ ] Binary Search (Classic)
- [ ] Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- [ ] Subarray Sum Equals K
- [ ] Range Sum Query – Immutable
- [ ] Single Number
- [ ] Number of 1 Bits

---

### 🔹 LLD: File Storage System

- [ ] Start designing a **basic file storage system**:
  - [ ] User uploads and retrieves files
  - [ ] Storage tracking (map fileId to file path)
  - [ ] Design interfaces: IStorage, IUploader
- [ ] Plan for:
  - [ ] In-memory vs disk storage logic
  - [ ] Handling duplicate uploads and retrieval
  - [ ] Error handling and size limits

- [ ] UML + README documentation
- [ ] Push project to GitHub

---

### 🔹 Blog/Content

- [ ] Finalize Blog #1 on DSA patterns
- [ ] Draft outline for Blog #2 on designing a Rate Limiter

## 🧠 Notes to Self

- Watch for off-by-one errors in Binary Search — draw arrays.
- Always validate assumptions before code (e.g., sorted input).
- Break your project into **1-hour chunks**. Don't wait for a "long session".

## 📌 Deliverables by End of Week

- [ ] ✅ 35 DSA problems solved
- [ ] ✅ File Storage System MVP live with README
- [ ] ✅ Blog #1 published on LinkedIn/Medium
- [ ] ✅ GitHub repo updated with LLD project
- [ ] ✅ Tracker updated with solved problems and links
