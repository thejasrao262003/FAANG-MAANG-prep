# 📅 June – Week 3 (June 15–21) – DP Foundations + Project Polish

## 🎯 Weekly Goal:
Introduce yourself to Dynamic Programming (DP) and solidify previously learned patterns. This week is also for refactoring and testing both LLD projects with a clean, production-ready structure.

---

## ✅ Weekly Targets

### 🔹 DSA: Dynamic Programming – Basics to Intermediate

- [ ] Solve 40 Leetcode problems:
  - [ ] Classic DP problems (Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Fibonacci)
  - [ ] 1D vs 2D DP understanding
  - [ ] Tabulation vs Memoization
  - [ ] State definition and transition logic

### Recommended Problems:
- [ ] Climbing Stairs (1D DP)
- [ ] House Robber
- [ ] Maximum Product Subarray
- [ ] Unique Paths
- [ ] Longest Common Subsequence
- [ ] Minimum Path Sum

---

### 🔹 LLD: Polish Rate Limiter & File Storage System

- [ ] Refactor both projects with:
  - [ ] Modular file structure
  - [ ] Class-level documentation
  - [ ] Better naming conventions
- [ ] Add:
  - [ ] Unit tests for all public methods
  - [ ] README with diagrams
  - [ ] Test cases for edge scenarios

- [ ] Make both projects **resume-ready** and commit to GitHub

---

### 🔹 Blog/Content

- [ ] Start Blog #2: "Designing a File Storage System from Scratch"
- [ ] Share key learnings from Rate Limiter and File Storage with visuals

## 🧠 Notes to Self

- For each DP problem, ask: "What decisions do I make at each step?"
- Don’t skip writing brute-force solutions. It improves intuition.
- Use `pytest` or similar to run automated tests on LLD projects.
