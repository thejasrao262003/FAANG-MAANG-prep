# 📅 July – Week 1 (July 1–7) – DP Mastery & Cache System LLD

## 🎯 Weekly Goal:
Advance your problem-solving with classic and intermediate Dynamic Programming problems. Begin your next Low-Level Design project: implementing a cache system (starting with LRU).

---

## ✅ Weekly Targets

### 🔹 DSA: Dynamic Programming II – State Transitions

- [ ] Solve 35 Leetcode problems:
  - [ ] Focus on:
    - [ ] Knapsack variations
    - [ ] LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence)
    - [ ] Partition Equal Subset Sum
    - [ ] Decode Ways
    - [ ] Coin Change
- [ ] Continue tagging problems in your tracker
- [ ] Review key transitions: dimensions, overlapping subproblems, base case handling

### Recommended Problems:
- [ ] 0/1 Knapsack
- [ ] Longest Increasing Subsequence
- [ ] Partition Equal Subset Sum
- [ ] Decode Ways
- [ ] Coin Change

---

### 🔹 LLD: Cache System – LRU Cache

- [ ] Learn Cache replacement policies:
  - [ ] LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - [ ] LFU (Least Frequently Used) – next week
- [ ] Implement LRU from scratch:
  - [ ] Use Doubly Linked List + HashMap combo
  - [ ] Design clean interface: get(), put()
  - [ ] Add capacity constraint handling
  - [ ] Write detailed test cases

- [ ] Stretch:
  - [ ] Benchmark vs Python’s `OrderedDict`

---

### 🔹 Blog/Content

- [ ] Brainstorm Blog #3: “Why LRU Works and How to Build It”
- [ ] Plan visuals for cache mechanics

## 🧠 Notes to Self

- Visualize LRU with a queue simulation — draw transitions.
- When solving DP, note:
  - [ ] Dimensions of DP table
  - [ ] Transition formula
  - [ ] Space optimizations (rolling arrays)

## 📌 Deliverables by End of Week

- [ ] ✅ 35 DP problems solved (Knapsack, LIS, etc.)
- [ ] ✅ LRU Cache fully implemented and tested
- [ ] ✅ Blog outline + visual sketches ready
- [ ] ✅ Project pushed to GitHub with README
- [ ] ✅ Tracker updated with progress and learnings
