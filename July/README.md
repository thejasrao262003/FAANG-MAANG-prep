# üü° July ‚Äì Medium/Hard DSA + LLD Deep Dive

## üéØ Objective:
Advance from foundational problem solving to medium and hard-level DSA. Deep dive into more complex Low-Level Design problems with extensibility, OOP principles, and scalability in mind. Start mock interviews and build interview endurance.
