# 📅 October – Week 3 (Oct 15–21) – System Design & Core CS Round Mastery

## 🎯 Weekly Goal:
Focus on mastering System Design and Core CS subjects (OS, DBMS, CN) — crucial for L3/L4-level interviews at FAANG. Your goal this week is to simulate SD+CS interviews, revise theory, and build confidence with whiteboard-level explanation.

## ✅ Weekly Targets

### 🔹 Mock Interviews – Core Tech

- [ ] System Design Mock Round (LLD + HLD blend):
  - [ ] Design a rate limiter, cache system, or job scheduler
- [ ] Core CS Mock Round (Verbal or Notion-based):
  - [ ] OS: Threads vs processes, scheduling
  - [ ] DBMS: Indexing, Transactions, Isolation Levels
  - [ ] CN: TCP/IP, Latency, Load balancer

- [ ] Self-review:
  - [ ] Use Notion table to track confidence levels
  - [ ] Identify any concepts that feel fuzzy

---

### 🔹 Core CS Revision (Interview Style)

- [ ] OS:
  - [ ] Process vs Thread, Context Switching, Scheduling Algorithms
- [ ] DBMS:
  - [ ] Normalization, Joins, Indexes, Isolation Levels
- [ ] CN:
  - [ ] HTTP vs HTTPS, DNS, CDN, TCP vs UDP

- [ ] Create 1-pager cheat sheets for each

---

### 🔹 DSA + Design Practice

- [ ] Solve 5 problems:
  - [ ] 2 Design-related questions (LFU Cache, Twitter clone)
  - [ ] 3 Hard problems (Heap, Trie, Segment Tree)

- [ ] Weekly Leetcode Contest OR Mock Coding Interview (90 mins)

### 🔹 Blog/Content

- [ ] Blog #14: “Cracking Core CS + System Design Rounds at FAANG”
- [ ] LinkedIn post with a simple HLD diagram carousel

## 🧠 Notes to Self

- System Design isn’t about buzzwords — it's about **trade-offs**.
- Learn to **drive the interview** — ask questions, define scope, clarify.
- Use diagrams + component names while explaining out loud.
