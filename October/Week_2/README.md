# 📅 October – Week 2 (Oct 8–14) – Mock Round 2 & Project Deep Dive Interviews

## 🎯 Weekly Goal:
Get deeper into mock interviews, especially for tech rounds that involve project deep dives. Be ready to talk about architecture, trade-offs, and “why” behind every decision you made. Build storytelling confidence and sharpen your decision-making logic.

## ✅ Weekly Targets

### 🔹 Mock Interviews – Deeper Dive

- [ ] Tech Mock 3: Advanced DSA (Graphs + DP)
- [ ] Tech Mock 4: Project System Design Deep Dive (on your flagship build)
- [ ] Behavioral Mock 2 (Leadership questions, “Conflict resolution”, “Failure case”)

- [ ] Self-assess:
  - [ ] How confident were you explaining your system?
  - [ ] Did you show metrics, choices, trade-offs?
  - [ ] Was your narrative structured and clear?

### 🔹 Project Polish

- [ ] Flagship Project:
  - [ ] Improve README with real-world use case explanation
  - [ ] Add Postman collection or API documentation
  - [ ] Include architecture diagram or MermaidJS block
  - [ ] Optional: Add usage metrics on homepage (visits, # jobs run, etc.)

---

### 🔹 DSA Practice

- [ ] Solve:
  - [ ] 5 medium/hard problems around Trees, Graphs, or Bit Manipulation
  - [ ] Simulate 1 Leetcode weekly contest (90 min)

- [ ] Revise:

## 🧠 Notes to Self

- Don’t memorize — explain naturally using engineering judgment.
- Project interviews are about “Why” > “What”.
